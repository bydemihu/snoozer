### Snoozer: AI face-tracking productivity tool!
Snoozer uses your webcam to capture your face and the Tensorflow.js face landmark detection model to detect when you're dozing off. It's easy to install and use: simply add Snoozer to Chrome [here], and it'll create a minimizable popup that will keep you on your toes as you use the web.

### You snooze, you lose.
Rest your eyes for a few seconds too long, and receive a nasty jumpscare that'll shock you awake and back to productivity. Feel the weight of shame as your **snooze counter** goes up each time you doze off in a Snoozer session. In a lecture or meeting? No worries, you can toggle **quiet mode.** Get too used to Snoozer's default sounds and images like your morning alarm? Upload your own files in **settings**.

### But...why?
Snoozer is a machine learning project that humorously addresses a plight that affects many students and employees, but simultaneously criticizes hustle culture and the toxicity of an environment that prioritizes productivity over health. Inspired by real-world digital surveillance tools used in schools and workplaces, Snoozer explores the trade-off between privacy and propriety. Despite seeming innocuous or even helpful for maintaining focus, it exacerbates the underlying issue of overworking to the point of exhaustion.
